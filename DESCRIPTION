Description: This package addresses the mean-variance relationship in spatially
  resolved transcriptomics data. Precision weights are generated for individual
  observations using Empirical Bayes techniques. These weights are used to
  rescale the data and covariates, which are then used as input in spatially
  variable gene detection tools.
